Pi-Starbug
==========

This project is a Raspberry Pi powered sensor module that collects indoor temperature and humidity, then sends data back to [Holly](https://github.com/projectweekend/Holly) at scheduled intervals. It also checks its own CPU temperature each hour and sends that back to Pi-Holly.
